Project goals were to refactor the code base for the Horiseon Social Solutions Company.  Major items that need atention were:
a. header links
b. standardizing the colors and fonts
c. organizing the CSS file to accurately detail the flow of the HTML document
d. add comments in CSS to help detail what elements were being affected by the code
e. add comments in HTML to show where elements of the page exist

Addition and changes to website

1. index.html - Added the title element from website to Horiseon Social Solution Services

2. Style.css - Modified the header <h1> to have one name, eliminating the .header h1 .seo class in style.css.  Created a new header h1 for the font size and color.

3. Style.css - Created comments to show where sections begin.

4. Style.css - Standardized the background colors (#2a607c), text color (#ffffff), and font-family ('Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;) over the entire site.

5. Style.css - Moved all of the benefit class styling below the content class styling. 

6. index.html - Added ID to the <h2> tages so when clicked the page would jump to the corresponding content.
